<p>Web DesignerðŸŒˆNew York City</p>
<p style="font-family: Aboreto, Almendra Display, monospace, sans-serif;">Hey there! I'm a graphic design student studying at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, and I'm currently participating in a Web Design fellowship program at The Knowledge House. I have a great eye for style and color, and I'm quite skilled at using Adobe products like PhotoShop, Illustrator, and In-Design. I'm especially interested in 3-D imaging and broadening my understanding of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's exhilarating to acquire new skills and challenge myself creatively! </p><body>
